                        <br>A priority of Food Lover Restaurant will be serving fresh, healthful fare with all selections made on the premises from "scratch." 
                        To keep food costs down, the menu will be simple, yet creative with many interchangeable ingredients. Foods will come from local 
                        and regional suppliers whenever possible, with a preference for organically grown products. A deli counter, fine coffees, and a fresh juice bar will also be showcased.

                        <br>Setting the mood of a '50s diner with decor, Food Lover Restaurant will be a simple 50-seat cafe with neon signage, checkered tile 
                        floors, grey booths with formica/chrome tables, a refurbished pressed-tin ceiling with ceiling fans, and a lunch counter 
                        (with the look of an old soda fountain) to match the tables. Only counter service will be offered to keep labor costs low. This 
                        will also keep the dining costs reasonable for consumers self-service with no tipping expenses.
